Problem Statement

A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase 
behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different 
categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high
volume products from last month.
The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type,
 stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and 
Total purchase_amount from last month.
Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against 
various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against
different products.

model performance will be evaluated on the basis of your prediction of the purchase 
amount for the test data (test.csv), which contains similar data-points as train except 
for their purchase amount.
Submissions are scored on the root mean squared error (RMSE).RMSE is very common and is a suitable 
general-purpose error metric. Compared to the Mean Absolute Error, RMSE punishes large 
errors

Public leaderboard is based on 30% of the test dataset, while 70% of the dataset is used for Private Leaderboard.
The final results would be declared only on Private Leaderboard
